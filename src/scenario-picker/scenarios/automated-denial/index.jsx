      <H2>Setup</H2>
      <P>
        Start by setting up and configuring the Edge-O-Matic for the Slave,
        insert the inflatable butt plug and plug into the machine. Lay the Slave
        down into position on his back with arms above his head. Secure the
        Slave’s legs, forcing them together, make sure the penis is poking out.
        Tie his legs to a secure anchor point (this could be a best post) so the
        Slave cannot pull his legs up. Do the same with his arms, tie together
        and then secure to an anchor point above his head so he cannot pull his
        arms down. Add the vibrator and sleeve by attaching it to the Slave’s
        penis, position it so it feels good when turned on. Use a belt or strap
        around the Slave’s legs (or other method) to secure the vibrator to the
        Slave, you don’t want it slipping.

          <li>Use a gag on the Slave to make them feel more vulnerable</li>
          <li>
            Add further restraints to better secure the Slave in place:
            <ul>
              <li>Around the legs to stop them being spread apart</li>
              <li>Around the arms to keep them from moving around</li>
              <li>By his side to prevent squirming</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </P>

      <H3>Introduction</H3>
      <P>
        Once the Slave is positioned securly and hooked up to the Edge-O-Matic,
        you’ll want to test that the vibrator is positioned in a way that feels
        good to the Slave. Adjust until it does. You probably want to be around
        for the first few edges to check the mechanism works correctly. If the
        device doesn’t shut off you might want to reconfigure/adjust some
        settings. Communication with the Slave is key here.
      </P>
      <Optional>
        Once you’re ready you could explain to the Slave what’s going to happen
        and why you’re doing this. This could hint towards one of the endings.

      <H3>The Edging</H3>
      <P>
        When ready switch the Edge-O-Matic into automatic mode and the vibrator
        will ramp up to speed stopping if it detects an orgasm coming. It will
        wait an amount of time before ramping up the vibrator again. A lot of
        those options can be configured if you desire:
        <ul>
          <li>Max vibrator speed</li>
          <li>Vibrator ramp rate</li>
          <li>Time before reset after detection of orgasm</li>
        </ul>
      </P>
      <P>
        Leave the Slave until he has been denied… 50 times? 100 times? 200
        times!? Or for a pre-arranged time… 30 minutes? 1 hour? 2 hours!? - If
        you’re using a gag; make sure that it is comfortable if you’re leaving
        them for a long time. Make sure to keep checking in on the Slave at
        least a frequently as once every 10 minutes.{' '}
        <Optional>
          Using the web application could give you some more insight while in
          another room.

      <H3>Ending</H3>
      <P>
        To finish the scene you could do a number of things. Here are some
        suggestions:
        <ol type='A'>
          <li>
            Ruined orgasm - increase the arousal limit on the Edge-O-Matic after
            each successful edge until it is too high to detect an orgasm before
            it happens, instead it will detect the orgasm too late and cause the
            vibrator to cut off just before orgasm but too late to prevent
            ejaculation.
            <ol type='i'>
              <li>
                <Optional>
                  Once you’ve done this you could even start the scene again for
                  another period of time (make sure to reset the arousal limit).
                </Optional>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Allowed orgasm - switch the Edge-O-Matic to manual mode and increase
            the vibrator gradually until the Slave cums.{' '}
            <Optional>
              Then switch back to automatic mode to apply post-orgasm torture to
              the Slave.
            </Optional>
            <ol type='i'>
              <li>
                <Optional>
                  The Edge-O-Matic has a web application that controls the
                  device. This ending could be triggered from another room
                  (without the Slave’s knowledge) for an extra surprising
                  ending.
                </Optional>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Victory orgasm - use other means to grant your Slave an orgasm.
            They’ve achieved something with this scene, reward them by making
            them cum in their favourite way. Maybe give them oral or ride their
            dick until they cum.
          </li>
          <li>
            Perfect Slave - your Slave is certainly going to be incredibly horny
            and subservient now, you can use this to your advantage an use them
            to pleasure you before you let them orgasm. Use this opportunity to
            do another scene now they’ve been perfectly prepared, they’d do
            anything for you at this point.
            <ol type='i'>
              <li>
                While you are leaving your Slave to be edged you should be
                setting up this next scene. Don’t forget to check on your Slave
                though.
